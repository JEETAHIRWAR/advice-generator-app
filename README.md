### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to use the Fetch API to retrieve data from an external source and update the content dynamically on the webpage. I also improved my skills in responsive design, incorporating box shadows, and creating interactive elements.




### Continued development

I plan to continue refining my skills in JavaScript, especially in handling asynchronous operations and improving the overall user experience. Additionally, I aim to explore more advanced styling techniques and experiment with different design patterns.
